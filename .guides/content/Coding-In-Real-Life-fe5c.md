# Maintenance
If you have expressed interest in programming for Andover Robotics Club, you have probably made your own programs before. While they might have been easy to write, have you ever noticed how they gradually become more difficult to understand as time passes?

This phenomenon alludes to a fundamental principle of software engineering professionalism: that **code becomes more difficult to maintain over time**.

Keep in mind that once we write some code for our robots, we will need to maintain it for the rest of the season. Any anomaly that occurs on the field—and they will happen!—requires us to reinspect potentially dated code and make changes quickly and efficiently. In accordance with Agile principles, our code should be **flexible** yet **robust**.
